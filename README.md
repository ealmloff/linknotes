# Tauri + React + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Setup / Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the app

You can start the app locally with:
```sh
npx tauri dev
```

Key Components
src/App.tsx
The App component is a functional component in a TypeScript React application that renders a TextEditor component within a div with the class name "app-container".

src/TextEditor.tsx
The TextEditor component provides a rich text editor interface using Slate.js. It includes functionalities for creating, editing, saving, and deleting notes, as well as managing tags and searching within notes.

src-tauri/src/lib.rs
This file initializes the Tauri application with various plugins and handlers for workspace and note management. It includes the run function to start the Tauri application and the bert function to initialize the BERT model which is later used to create embeddings for semantic search and classification.

src-tauri/src/note.rs
This file manages contextual documents within a Tauri-based workspace. It includes functionality for saving, retrieving, updating, tagging, and deleting documents. The code also incorporates classification logic for tagging documents using embeddings generated by BERT.

src-tauri/src/classifier.rs
This file includes the classifier logic for tagging documents using embeddings generated by BERT. Classification is done with a small neural network trined to predict tags for each sentence of existing notes.

src-tauri/src/search.rs
This file provides a framework for searching notes, including functionality to search for notes based on text and tags, as well as to search for context around a cursor position in a note.

Commands
save_note
Saves a note with a title and contents in a workspace.

read_note
Reads a note from a specific path.

remove_note
Removes a note from a specific path.

set_tags
Sets the tags for a note with the given title in the workspace.

get_tags
Gets the tags for a note with the given title in the workspace.

context_search
Searches for context around a cursor position in a note.

Testing
src-tauri/src/note.rs
This file includes tests for the note module, such as test_set_tags.

Configuration
src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
This file contains the Tauri configuration for the application.
