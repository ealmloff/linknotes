What is Science?
Definition:
Science is the systematic study of the natural world through observation, experimentation, and analysis. It seeks to understand phenomena, establish facts, and develop theories and laws based on evidence.

Purpose:
The purpose of science is to explain the workings of the universe, solve practical problems, and improve our quality of life through technological and intellectual advancements.

Branches of Science:

Natural Sciences: Physics, Chemistry, Biology.
Earth and Space Sciences: Geology, Meteorology, Astronomy.
Applied Sciences: Engineering, Medicine, Computer Science.
Social Sciences: Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology.


Key Concepts in Science
The Scientific Method:

Steps: Observation → Hypothesis → Experiment → Analysis → Conclusion → Repeat.
Ensures objectivity and repeatability in research.
Theories and Laws:

Theory: A well-substantiated explanation (e.g., Theory of Evolution).
Law: A statement of observable facts (e.g., Newton's Laws of Motion).
Empirical Evidence:

Data collected through observation or experiment.
Interdisciplinary Nature:

Science often integrates multiple disciplines for comprehensive understanding (e.g., Biophysics, Astrobiology).


Example 1: Gravity
Overview:
Gravity is the force of attraction between objects with mass, described by Isaac Newton and later expanded by Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.

Einstein’s Theory of Relativity:
Gravity is the warping of spacetime by mass.

Applications:

Understanding planetary orbits.
Predicting tides.
Engineering spacecraft.

Example 3: The Periodic Table
Overview:
The periodic table organizes chemical elements based on their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties.

Key Contributions:

Dmitri Mendeleev (1869): Proposed the first version.
Modern table includes 118 elements, organized into groups and periods.
Applications:

Predicting chemical reactions.
Understanding material properties.
Advancing fields like medicine and engineering.
