What is Mathematics?
Definition:
Mathematics is the abstract science of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns. It uses logical reasoning and symbolic representation to solve problems, analyze structures, and understand relationships.

Purpose:
Mathematics serves as the foundation for numerous fields, including physics, computer science, engineering, economics, and biology. It aids in problem-solving, modeling real-world phenomena, and advancing technological innovation.

Branches of Mathematics:

Arithmetic: Study of numbers and basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Algebra: Deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating them.
Geometry: Study of shapes, sizes, and properties of space.
Calculus: Explores change through derivatives and integrals.
Statistics and Probability: Analyzing data and measuring uncertainty.


Key Concepts in Mathematics
Abstraction and Generalization:

Representing complex problems using simpler symbols or rules.
Logical Reasoning:

Following structured steps to arrive at a conclusion.
Theorems and Proofs:

A theorem is a mathematical statement, proven using axioms and logic.
Applications of Math:

Physics: Modeling motion (calculus).
Finance: Compound interest (algebra).
Engineering: Structural analysis (geometry and calculus).


Example 1: Pythagorean Theorem
Overview:
The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Formula:
𝑐
2
=
𝑎
2
+
𝑏
2
c 
2
 =a 
2
 +b 
2
 
Where 
𝑐
c is the hypotenuse, and 
𝑎
a, 
𝑏
b are the other sides.

Applications:

Measuring distances.
Engineering and construction.
Navigation and GPS calculations.

Example 2: Derivatives in Calculus
Overview:
A derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable. It measures how a function's value changes as its input changes.

Key Concept:
If 
𝑦
=
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
y=f(x), the derivative 
𝑓

(
𝑥
)
f

Applications:

Physics: Velocity as the derivative of position.
Economics: Marginal cost and revenue.
Biology: Population growth rates.

Example 3: Probability
Overview:
Probability quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring. It ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

Key Formula:
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
=
Number of favorable outcomes
Total number of outcomes
P(A)= 
Total number of outcomes
Number of favorable outcomes
​
 

Example Problem:
If a die is rolled, what is the probability of rolling a 4?
𝑃
(
4
)
=
1
6
P(4)= 
6
1
​
 

Applications:

Risk assessment in finance.
Predicting outcomes in science experiments.
Designing algorithms (e.g., random sampling).
