Physics
Definition:
Physics is the study of matter, energy, and the interactions between them. It explores the fundamental laws that govern the universe.

Purpose:
Physics helps us understand natural phenomena, predict outcomes, and develop technology based on these principles.

Branches of Physics:

Classical Mechanics: Motion of objects.
Thermodynamics: Heat and energy transfer.
Electromagnetism: Electric and magnetic forces.
Quantum Mechanics: Behavior of particles at atomic scales.
Relativity: Effects of motion near the speed of light.
Key Concepts in Physics
Newton's Laws of Motion:

First Law: An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted on by a force.
Second Law: 
𝐹
=
𝑚
𝑎
F=ma (Force equals mass times acceleration).
Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Energy Conservation:

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
Wave-Particle Duality:

Particles like electrons exhibit both wave and particle behavior.
Relativity:

Time and space are relative and affected by motion and gravity (Einstein).
Example 1: Kinetic Energy
